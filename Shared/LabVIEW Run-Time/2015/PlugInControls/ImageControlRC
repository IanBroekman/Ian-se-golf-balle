5   Scroll event - A user has moved the scrollbars the image display control.
8   Double Click Event - A user has double clicked in the image display control.
 
Type returns the type of event. See Which Events for possible values of Type.
 
Tool returns the tool used to generate the event.
 
Coordinates indicates the relative position of the event.
